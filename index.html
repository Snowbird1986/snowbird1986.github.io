        <p>My name is Jeff Kounter.  I am 32 yrs old with a Masters in Business administration focused in finance.   I also hold a BBA with minors in management, accounting, and math, both from Wichita State University.   Go Shox!!  I currently work as a Loan Service Analyst for agricultural loans.
            </p>
        <p>I have been developing my understanding of SQL in excel via the usage of the functions and interconnectivity of the files.   The links to connect the files together and find ways to automate the process by which data in digital format can be input into another digital form with minimal human involvement.   Therefore, I have taken the logical next step of learning how to do this with more than just SQL and Office/Excel based languages.
